  "readme": "# simplog\n\nThe simplest useful log module imaginable. \n\nWrites messages to stdout (as in [12 Factor\nApp] (http://www.12factor.net/logs)) using the node.js util.log and util.format\nmethods.\n\n\n#### Installation\n    npm install simplog\n\n#### Usage\nSupports error, info, warn, debug and a handy event method.  It's\nwritten in coffee script and you should be too (that was deliberate).\n\n    log.error \"this is an error\"\n    log.info  \"this is informational\"\n    log.warn  \"this is a warning\"\n    log.debug \"this is a debug message and will only show up if process.env.DEBUG or window.debug is truthy\"\n    log.event \"this will log with the type [EVENT] and will only show up if process.env.DEBUG is truthy\"\n\n#### Formatting\nIt's even possible to use string formatting with it, like:\n\n    log.info \"that %s looked like %j\", object_name, object\n\nUnder the covers it's just using node's util.format and supports what\nyou would expect.\n\n#### Output\nAs of 0.0.5 the output includes a pid as follows\n\n    22 May 22:07:44 - [15794] [ERROR] look ma, an error\n\nIf you decide you like the old way, sans pid:\n\n    22 May 22:07:44 - [ERROR] look ma, an error\n\nyou can make `process.env.NOLOGPID` truthy and it will go away.  If there's something called window in the global scope, we'll skip the PID in any output.  Reasonable?\n",
